Pesticides Market Outlook :
Chemical control of pests is a common practice in agriculture. There are more than a thousand pesticides of both chemical and biological nature, used around the world to minimize crop losses. Agriculture in developing countries suffers most because of high incidence of various pests. Although chemical pesticides are well known for their effectiveness, their impact on soil and environment, and presence of residue in food products are a matter of concern. Other issues relate to structure of pesticide industry and the regulations for registration and quality assessment.
